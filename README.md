# ITI-NLP-assignments

This repository contains assignments and tasks completed as part of the NLP (Natural Language Processing) course. Each file corresponds to a specific task or project related to NLP concepts and techniques.

## Repository Contents

- [**`sskip_gram_cbow.ipynb`**](https://github.com/Amadoabad/ITI-NLP-assignments/blob/main/sskip_gram_cbow.ipynb): 
  - A Jupyter notebook demonstrating skip-gram and CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words) models using Gensim. 
  - It includes examples of loading pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe) and finding similar words or averaging embeddings.

- [**`ner_with_spacy.ipynb`**](https://github.com/Amadoabad/ITI-NLP-assignments/blob/main/ner_with_spacy.ipynb):
  - A Jupyter notebook showcasing Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy.
  - It covers loading and processing datasets (e.g., CoNLL 2003), converting data to SpaCy-compatible formats, and preparing training configurations for NER pipelines.

- [**`testing_building_model.ipynb`**](https://github.com/Amadoabad/ITI-NLP-assignments/blob/main/testing_building_model.ipynb):
  - A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates building and training a PyTorch model.
  - It includes steps for creating a training loop, defining a regression dataset, and utilizing various PyTorch functionalities, such as `torch.nn` and `DataLoader`.
  - The notebook uses a 1D regression dataset with a multi-layer neural network for training and evaluation.

- [**`lec3-stackedlayerednetwork.ipynb`**](https://github.com/Amadoabad/ITI-NLP-assignments/blob/main/lec3-stackedlayerednetwork.ipynb):
  - A Jupyter notebook exploring sentiment analysis using a stacked and layered neural network.
  - It uses the IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify reviews as positive or negative.
  - The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.
  - Techniques covered include embedding layers, recurrent layers (e.g., LSTM or Bidirectional LSTM), and performance optimization using PyTorch.
