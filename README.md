# ITI-NLP-assignments

This repository contains assignments and tasks completed as part of the NLP (Natural Language Processing) course. Each file corresponds to a specific task or project related to NLP concepts and techniques.

## Repository Contents

- **`sskip_gram_cbow.ipynb`**: 
  - A Jupyter notebook demonstrating skip-gram and CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words) models using Gensim. 
  - It includes examples of loading pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe) and finding similar words or averaging embeddings.

- **`ner_with_spacy.ipynb`**:
  - A Jupyter notebook showcasing Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy.
  - It covers loading and processing datasets (e.g., CoNLL 2003), converting data to SpaCy-compatible formats, and preparing training configurations for NER pipelines.

- **`testing_building_model.ipynb`**:
  - A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates building and training a PyTorch model.
  - It includes steps for creating a training loop, defining a regression dataset, and utilizing various PyTorch functionalities, such as `torch.nn` and `DataLoader`.
  - The notebook uses a 1D regression dataset with a multi-layer neural network for training and evaluation.

## Course Overview

This repository will continue to be updated with more tasks as the course progresses. The tasks are aimed at exploring various NLP techniques, libraries, and models.
